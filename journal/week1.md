Study Notes:
- Why Containerise the application
- Makes application portable
- Avoid envionrment configuration repition work
- Consistent environment between developers
- Consistent environment between dev -> uat -> prd
        
- Recommended	by @jamesspurin: linuxserver.io
- Docker Hub = Container Registry hosted by Docker co.
- OCI = Open Container Initiative, Docker Hub meets OCI standard

Action: confirmed I have dockerhub account  
Action: checked for extension, but Gitpod did not have the VSCode extension for Docker installed  
Action: installed VSCode Docker extension for local install and gitpod workspace  

- Docker image "scratch" = official base image  
- Dockers layers = union filesystem  
- What is a docker "volume"? = volume local to the running container

### Note
Got Codespaces up and running with config that matches GitPod Workspace
Interesting to note that when choosing to launch to local VSCode instance the extensions I defined get installed, I don't think I saw that with GitPod when launching VSCode locally (the terminal was still going to GitPod hosted container)

28/FEB/2023  
Worked on learning GitPod Workspace configuration

01/03/2023  
Worked on learning GitHub CodeSpaces configuration

#Note
I accidentally deleted my Workspace and when I started a new one I saw that I have lost my local install and extensions, so I went down the rabbit hole of gitpod.yml and devcontainer.json configuration, so that AWS CLI is always installed locally, and VSCode extensions do not need reinstalling.  
Ref: https://www.gitpod.io/docs/references/ides-and-editors/vscode-extensions

I found the same functionality difference, in that with CodeSpaces I can see and use "add extension to devcontainer" in browser or local VScode, whereas in gitpod I only see "add to gitpod.yml" in the browser.  
It has been a fun exercise learning how to configure gitpod and codespaces so that installations and extensions are preserved if I start from a new Github CodeSpace or GitPod Workspace.  
Additionally, by having out of sync local repos running in parallel in CodeSpaces and GitPod due to updating their config files, I learn the "git pull --rebase" command to fix my repo sync issues (successfully!)

## Containerise BackEnd

01/MAR/2023  
Watching: Week 1 - Live Streamed Video (Week 1 - App Containerization)  
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJnNe5Nv4tE&list=PLBfufR7vyJJ7k25byhRXJldB5AiwgNnWv&index=23 (00h:45m to 01h:40m)  
Study Notes:  
```pip3 install -r requirements.txt```  
(this was executed in dev env)

==need to this in gitpod to stay in sync==

*Web server is running but 404'ing due to frontend_url and backend_url env var not being configured, the proper URL is /api/activities/home*

Action: (locally)  
`cd backend-flask
export FRONTEND_URL="*"
export BACKEND_URL="*"
python3 -m flask run --host=0.0.0.0 --port=4567`  
(make sure the port is unlocked/public, got to port take in vscode, open link and apped /api/activities/home to check all okay)

In Dockerfile:  
RUN = cmd creating a layer in the image  
CMD = cmd executed once the container is running

`unset FRONTEND_URL
unset BACKEND_URL
env | grep FRONTEND_URL
env | grep BACKEND_URL`  

Action: (locally - starting from home dir)  
`docker build -t backend-flask ./backend-flask`

*-t is tagging the container (name:tag so backend-flask:latest by default)  
./ from home/subdirectory*

Action: (run the container)  
`docker run --rm -p 4567:4567 -it backend-flask`

Problem due to missing ENV VARS

Action: (lets looks inside the container to see if ENV VARS are set) 
1. `docker exec -it ${CONTAINER_ID} /bin/bash`
2. attach shell using the Docker extension
(run the env command and you can see the two URL vars are not set)

Solution  
1. Add the ENV VARS in the Dockerfile  
2. Pass the ENV VARS to the docker  
if the ENV VARS are already set locally, you don't even need to explicitly pass the full VAR to the docker run command, so;
`docker run --rm -p 4567:4567 -it -e FRONTEND_URL='*' -e BACKEND_URL='*' backend-flask`
is the same as  
`docker run --rm -p 4567:4567 -it -e FRONTEND_URL -e BACKEND_URL backend-flask`  
single-quote the var value due to shell interpretation of what is in " "

Study Notes:  

Action: (run container in background, ie returns the container ID and then gives back the command prompt)
`docker container run --rm -p 4567:4567 -d -e FRONTEND_URL='*' -e BACKEND_URL='*' backend-flask`

Action: (alternative, also assign the containerid to an env var)  
`CONTAINER_ID=$(docker run --rm -p 4567:4567 -d -e FRONTEND_URL='*' -e BACKEND_URL='*' backend-flask`  
`echo ${CONTAINER_ID}`  
`docker exec -it ${CONTAINER_ID} /bin/bash`

Action : (get Container Images or Running Container Ids)  
`docker ps` (see running containers)  
`docker ps -a` (need to use this to see stopped containers, if you run a container with -rm flag then when you stop a container the rm is automatic, for example for post-mortem troubleshooting, looking at container logs inside the container, but it's usual to sue -rm as containers are often run as disposable compute)  
`docker images` (to see all local images)

Action: (cURL to test the server from the terminal)  
`curl -X GET http://localhost:4567/api/activities/home -H "Accept: application/json" -H "Content-Type: application/json"`

## Containerise FrontEnd

Action: (to install NPM)  
`npm i`

Action:   
(create empty Dockerfile in frontend folder and copy contents from Andrew's journal)

Action: (could build the container like the backend)
`cd ..` (switch to home folder)  
`docker build -t frontend-react-js ./frontend-react-js`  
`docker run -p 3000:3000 -d frontend-react-js`

Build Multiple Containers using docker compose  
Action:  
(Create empty docker-compose.yml file at the root of your project and copy contents from Andrew's journal)

Action:
`docker compose up`  
or  
right-click on the file in VSCode and click 'Compose Up'

Note: All working, yay!!! :joy:

Action: Mount directories so we can make changes while we code (change message in home_acitivities.py)  
Note: notice change instantly reflected as the container has mounted the local directory as per docker compose yaml file.

Action: (stop both containers in one go) 
`docker stop containerid1 containerid2`  
eg docker stop d7b8086ef2e1 2dfe51f7dbe7

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAMHu1NiYoI&list=PLBfufR7vyJJ7k25byhRXJldB5AiwgNnWv&index=24  
Study Notes:

GitPod  
50hrs usage / month (actually 500 credits a month)  
Std: 4 cores, 8gb ram, 30gb storage  
Avoid running Workspaces in parallel as it will expend credits  
30mins timeout helps avoid using credits when you forget to stop a Workspace  
Calculator: https://www.gitpod.io/pricing

Github CodeSpaces  
60hrs/month @ 2core, 4gb ram, 15gb storage  
30hrs/month @ 4core, 8gb ram, 15gb storage  
https://github.com/features/codespaces  
https://github.com/pricing/calculator  

AWS Cloud9  
Free t2.micro instance in your account  
Avoid as it uses your ec2 t2 credits  
https://aws.amazon.com/cloud9/pricing/  
Note: its still cheap: If you use the default settings running an IDE for 4 hours per day for 20 days in a month with a 30-minute auto-hibernation setting your monthly charges for 90 hours of usage would be:  
Compute fees*	$1.05	t2.micro Linux instance at $0.0116/hour x 90 total hours used per month = $1.05  
Storage fees	$1.00	$0.10 per GB-month of provisioned storage x 10-GB storage volume = $1.00  
Total monthly fees	$2.05

CloudTrail  
Avoid unless necessary usage of services (for dev env)  
If need to use, minimize usage of options:  
Deselect KMS  
Deselect Data Events  
Deselect Inisghs Events  
Note: default is 90 days of CT data so you can still have some data even if not swticheed on

- document a new api endpoint in OpenAPI

Action: click show preview with default browser icon (top-right) to see openai (swagger view of the APIs)  
Action: can check OpenAPI specification at: https://spec.openapis.org/oas/latest.html  
Action: click on split tab to help with coding a new endpoint based on existing endpoint  
$ref: '#/components/schemas/Activity' = look at the bottom of the file, the schema is defined there and using the OpenAPI preview, you can see the schema for the new endpoint is updated with the schema details
