Study Notes: 
- Cyber Security = Technology risk the business may be exposed to
- Cloud Security = protect data, apps, services in your Cloud envrionments from internal and external security threats
1. Reduce impact of breach
2. Protect networks, apps, services from data theft
3. Reduce human error
Cloud/Cloud security - takes practice due to complexity, new services, threat actors improving capability

Enable MFA for root account - already done!  
- MFA important as compromised domain admin account = game over
- Can double check byu going to main profile -> secruity credentials and review root user config

Create an OU
- Root user account is the management account, recommended it should not have any applications, only used to create ORG / OU
- Example OU strategy = different business units or different environments (eng,dev,uat,prd etc)
- Example account strategy = Active Account OU + Standby Account OU (accounts can take time to create so can cerate in advance in Standby and move into Active as needed)

CloudTrail
- Moniotor data security and residence
- Region vs AZ vs Global
- Audit Logs for IR/Forensice
- Create CloudTrail logs - done

IAM Users
- Create IAM User
- 3 kinds of users in AWS - IAM user, system user, federated user
- Enable MFA for all human users
- Principle of Least Privilege
    
ACtion
- Delete access keys for Root User account - done
- Create IAM user - done
- Enable MFA on newly create IAM user - done

IAM Roles  
2 types off IAM roles & IAM policies - AWS managed vs custom

IAM roles vs IAM policies 
- Role = An IAM role is an identity you can create that has specific permissions with credentials that are valid for short durations. Roles can be assumed by entities that you trust.
- Policy = a group of permissions (ie a role can have inidividual perms assigned but better to use a policy to group up those perms)

Principle of Least Privilege

Create IAM role
